Smart Location Mapping

# Overview
Smart Location Mapping is a simple website that helps users find any place on a map using latitude and longitude.
The user enters two numbers, and the map shows the exact location with a pin.
The project is kept clear and simple, focusing on accuracy and easy understanding.
It is mainly designed for academic use, demos, and beginners who are learning how maps work on websites.

# Features
Users can enter latitude and longitude manually
A button is used to show the location on the map
The map is interactive and easy to use
Users can switch between street view and satellite view
Zoom in and zoom out options are available
The marker updates properly without overlapping
Input values are checked to avoid wrong coordinates
Coordinates are shown with direction (North, South, East, West)
A preset button loads College of Engineering Perumon instantly.

# Technologies Used
HTML – creates the structure of the webpage
CSS – makes the page look clean and readable
JavaScript – handles logic and user interaction
Leaflet.js – displays and controls the map
OpenStreetMap – provides street map data
Esri World Imagery – provides satellite images.

#How the Application Works
The user enters latitude and longitude values.
When the Show Location button is clicked, the inputs are checked.
The map loads using Leaflet.js.
The map moves to the entered coordinates.
A pin is placed at that exact position.
The user can change between street view and satellite view.
The coordinates are shown clearly without confusion.

# User Interaction
Manual Input: Type coordinates and click Show Location
Preset Button: Instantly load College of Engineering Perumon
Map Controls: Zoom in and out easily
Layer Control: Switch between street and satellite maps

# Coordinate Display
Coordinates are shown in:
Decimal Degrees (DD)
Direction format (N, S, E, W)
This helps users understand the location better and verify it easily.

# Deployment
The project runs as a static website
No backend or database is used
It works directly in any modern web browser
Internet is required to load the map

# Testing & Validation
Tested using known coordinate values
Confirmed correct pin placement
Checked zoom and map switching
Tested on both desktop and mobile browsers

# Limitations
Does not automatically detect user location
Cannot be used without internet
Accuracy depends on correct user input

# Academic Relevance
This project helps in understanding:
Basic frontend web development
How maps work on websites
How APIs and libraries are used
Practical use of latitude and longitude

# License
This project is created only for educational and academic purposes.
